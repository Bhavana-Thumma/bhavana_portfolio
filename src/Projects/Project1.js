        Worked on product backlog to understand.

For sign-in also included social login buttons for a better user experience. Worked on setting up the navbar for sign-in and signup components with toggle mode. Setting up the font size, family, etc, took little time. We have taken the feedback from mentors and peers to verify our sprint work and noted changes that are needed to be made. The colors and animation settings are done. Sign-in and Signup buttons were set. Integrated all the pages and worked on their responsiveness. Finally, an appealing sign-in signup page is created.
